           <p><h2><b style="font-size: 20px;"><u>My Review:</u></b></h2>After watching this movie like,for a 1000 times I have decided to write a review and what I feel towards one of the best classic love stories of Telugu film industry.This movie still remains as a masterpiece and a textbook to Classic Love stories in TFI.To start with it is actually a remake of Kollywood movie with the same name starring Vijay,Jyothika.Powerstar PawanKalyan who was in his best form and giving back to back blockbusters decided to remake this movie which was a huge hit in Tamil.Story starts with a cutest scene of the movie in which two cute babies smiling at each other and trying to shake their hands.This scene is accompanied by the melodious background score by Manisharma who is the master in doing that.Destiny makes them meet after they grow up and study in the same college.Siddu(PK) and Madhu(Bhoomika) together help their friend's relation.Later,Siddu and Madhu will be together for some time and later break up for an issue which you have to see it in the movie and at the end they reunite swaying over their ego which is the cause of this whole mess.This story works so well because of the dynamic between those two main characters Siddartha Roy(PawanKalyan) and Madhumathi(Bhoomika Chawla).Talking about the cast,You only care about these two characters.You would feel empathy for them whenever they are away and miss each other.You cannot escape from the charisma of PawanKalyan and his magical smile.He carried his character(Siddu)with such an ease. "Nuvvu gudumba satthi garu kaavochu thokkalo satthi garu kaavochu but I don't care because I am Siddu Siddartha Roy" Not to mention the beautiful Bhoomika Chawla who did a candid role Madhumathi.Screenplay of SJ Surya is fantastic.Music and background score by Manisharma is a major highlight which scintillates throughout the movie and that album is still one of my most favorite albums.Cheliya Cheliya,Ammaye sannaga,Ye mera jahaa are my top picks.Cinematography by P.C Sreeram is the major asset which stands as top in those times.If you didn't watch this movie and you like love stories what are you waiting for?Go and watch now!If you watched this already go and watch again as it never become old.I hope to see a Kushi type love story near future.</p>
